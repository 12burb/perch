# @perch/api-client

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 9d8ca25: apps/api skeleton: Hono + zod-openapi with the OpenAPI document at /api/openapi.json, the §7.8 error model with request ids, pino request logging with secret redaction, Perch-Version handling, GET /api/health and /api/version, boot wiring (env → db migrations → bus, vault, queue), and the generated TypeScript client (@perch/api-client) typed end to end.
- ed5ab78: Authentication (task 0.8): better-auth on the Drizzle adapter with email + password, passkeys
  (`@better-auth/passkey`, bound to `PERCH_PUBLIC_URL`), and generic OIDC through `PERCH_OIDC_*`; a Perch
  `users` profile row for every auth user; `GET/PATCH /api/me`; api tokens (`/api/me/tokens`, shown once,
  stored hashed, accepted as `Bearer pat_…`); workspaces with owner memberships; email invites
  (`POST /api/workspaces/{ws}/invites`, public preview, accept bound to the invited email); a public
  `GET /api/instance`; the first web routes (sign in, sign up, invite, security settings) with `t()` strings
  and design tokens from `@perch/ui`; Playwright e2e (`bun run e2e`) covering sign up, passkey sign-in, api
  tokens, and invite acceptance at 1440 px and 390 px.
- ae3e4ab: Deploy (task 0.13): `deploy/Dockerfile.api` (Bun runtime, Vite build under Node, non-root, `api | worker |
  supervisor`), `deploy/Dockerfile.runner` (the Ubuntu 24.04 runner base), `deploy/Dockerfile.caddy`
  (Caddy with a DNS-challenge module), the pinned `docker-compose.yml` with the `local` and `tunnel`
  profiles, the Caddyfiles, `.env.example`, `perch init` (writes `.env` with generated secrets, the compose
  file, and the Caddyfile), and the setup wizard: `POST /api/setup` creates the admin, the first workspace,
  confirms `PERCH_PUBLIC_URL`, records the telemetry choice, and sign-ups stay closed until it has run.
- e05fb7a: Resolve and pin every dependency named in the spec (docs/dependencies.md), with ADR-0019..0028 for the non-obvious picks; commit the lockfile.
- 62de53e: Workspaces, memberships, RBAC, and the audit log (task 0.9): `authorize(ctx, action, resource)` in
  `@perch/policy` (role matrix + token scopes) applied in every workspace handler, with non-members getting
  `not_found`; `GET/PATCH /api/workspaces/{ws}`, `GET /api/workspaces/{ws}/members`,
  `PATCH/DELETE /api/workspaces/{ws}/members/{user}` (owner rules, last-owner protection, leave);
  the `audit_log` table (migration 0003) written by a bus subscriber for every workspace event, with
  `GET /api/workspaces/{ws}/audit`; bus envelopes now carry `meta` (request id, client ip).
