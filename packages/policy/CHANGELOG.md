### Minor Changes

- 347ce60: Brains: bring your own models. Workspace settings gets a Brains section where you add an API key
  (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, Mistral, xAI, OpenRouter) or an OpenAI-compatible endpoint
  (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, a proxy), keep it to yourself or share it with the workspace, and test it
  against the provider's own model list. Name a model as a brain, make one the default for code, and
  pick it when you start a session — the engine gets that brain's key and base URL in its
  environment, and nothing else does. A local Ollama is detected and added in one click.
  
  Starting a session now names the agent separately from the model: the new-session form's **Agent**
  field says which ACP agent or CLI runs it (empty means the runner's default), and the **Brain**
  picker says which model it runs on. `POST /api/.../sessions` and the runner's `session.create` both
  take an `agent` alongside `model` for this.
- 9c29082: Connections, part one: the core of connecting a service. A connector is a manifest.yaml describing
  one provider — its lanes, its API base, the scopes to ask for — and GitHub's ships with Perch. You
  can paste a personal access token or install a GitHub App, and either way the secret goes into the
  vault and never comes back out to a caller: a connection shows the account it speaks as and a hint
  like `gi…wxyz`, nothing more. An App connection stores only the private key and mints a fresh
  installation token for each call. Cloning a project can now run on a connection, with the token
  minted for that one clone. The instance publishes its OAuth client metadata document at
  `/.well-known/oauth-client-metadata.json`, whose URL is the client_id it declares.
- f39b87d: Bots that answer. A workspace can now make a bot, give it a persona and a brain, put it in a channel
  and have it reply when it is named — streaming into its message the way a person's typing fills in,
  always in the thread it was asked in. Triggers cover mentions, DMs, keywords, a bot's own arrival, a
  reaction and a cron schedule; the native tools (web search, fetching a page, reading and posting in
  channels, remembering and recalling, thread facts) are each the bot's own, and everything they bring
  back is wrapped as untrusted so a webpage cannot tell a bot what to do. Every turn is on a ledger
  with its tokens and cost, and a bot over its daily budget or its rate limit says so instead of going
  quiet.
- 0985050: The policy engine: one written document says what may happen in a workspace, and a project can
  narrow it. Protected branches, refused commands, paths an agent may write, which models a channel or
  a project may use, ceilings on what may be spent, and how far bots may go tagging each other. A
  channel pinned to local models turns a cloud-brained bot away in the thread it was asked in, a push
  to a protected branch is refused before the runner is asked, and Settings → Policy has a dry run
  beside the document: type what somebody might do and see which rule decides.
- c4e921c: A project's environment: the variables its sessions, terminals and dev servers run with, encrypted
  at rest and write-only — a value goes in once, and the api only ever answers with the keys. The
  values are put in front of an agent's process and a terminal's shell, and taken out of everything
  written down: an agent that prints `$DATABASE_URL` leaves `[redacted: DATABASE_URL]` in the
  transcript, so the record people read and the transcript a model is shown later carry the name
  rather than the secret.
- 52af50e: Chat carries more than words. React to a message with an emoji and see who else did; attach a file
  and have an image show itself in the flow; paste a Perch identifier — `project:NEST`,
  `channel:general`, `session:8f2c` — and get a card for what it points at, but only ever for things
  you could have opened yourself. And when somebody mentions you while you are not looking, your
  phone says so: Perch registers a service worker, encrypts each notification to that device (RFC
  8291) and identifies itself to the push service with VAPID, so the service carries ciphertext and
  learns nothing about who it is for. Every upload downloads as an attachment and only real image
  types preview, so nothing anybody uploads can run on Perch's origin.
- bb1f0e5: Secret scanning before every commit. What a commit is about to take — including the files an agent
  has just written, which git has never seen — is read for the shapes providers stamp on their tokens,
  private keys, passwords in connection strings, and names that say secret beside a long value. A
  finding stops the commit and the Git panel shows a card saying what it is and which line it is on,
  with the value masked. Nothing is committed, so taking it out and committing again is all it takes.
  Placeholders, example files and lines being removed are left alone, and a repository can name its
  own exceptions in its policy.
- cc5c90d: Sessions: the Engine interface with a fake engine and a runner-hosted bridge, the
  coding_sessions/session_events tables, and api routes to open a session in a project, send turns,
  answer permissions, cancel, and replay the transcript from a seq; every event fans out live on the
  session's WS topic.

### Patch Changes

- de84546: Local runners: the Environments page lists a workspace's runners with live status, "Connect a machine"
  mints a connect token shown once inside the `perch runner connect` command, owners and admins remove
  runners, and `perch runner connect <url> --token …` joins a machine as one of your environments.
- f3aefb9: Projects: create one empty, upload files into one, or clone a repository (public, with an access
  token, or with the workspace's SSH deploy key) from Code mode or the API; the directory is set up on
  a runner, `.perch/project.json` is validated and applied, `devcontainer.json` is read and its
  `postCreateCommand` runs, and the row's status updates live.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 62de53e: Workspaces, memberships, RBAC, and the audit log (task 0.9): `authorize(ctx, action, resource)` in
  `@perch/policy` (role matrix + token scopes) applied in every workspace handler, with non-members getting
  `not_found`; `GET/PATCH /api/workspaces/{ws}`, `GET /api/workspaces/{ws}/members`,
  `PATCH/DELETE /api/workspaces/{ws}/members/{user}` (owner rules, last-owner protection, leave);
  the `audit_log` table (migration 0003) written by a bus subscriber for every workspace event, with
  `GET /api/workspaces/{ws}/audit`; bus envelopes now carry `meta` (request id, client ip).
