### Patch Changes

- 027121b: Core packages: the spec §7 contracts as Zod (bus event catalog, WS protocol, runner JSON-RPC, EngineEvent, error shape); an in-process bus with per-topic replay; a Postgres job queue with SKIP LOCKED claims, backoff, cron, and crash recovery; envelope encryption with rotation. Adds the jobs table (migration 0002).
- 62de53e: Workspaces, memberships, RBAC, and the audit log (task 0.9): `authorize(ctx, action, resource)` in
  `@perch/policy` (role matrix + token scopes) applied in every workspace handler, with non-members getting
  `not_found`; `GET/PATCH /api/workspaces/{ws}`, `GET /api/workspaces/{ws}/members`,
  `PATCH/DELETE /api/workspaces/{ws}/members/{user}` (owner rules, last-owner protection, leave);
  the `audit_log` table (migration 0003) written by a bus subscriber for every workspace event, with
  `GET /api/workspaces/{ws}/audit`; bus envelopes now carry `meta` (request id, client ip).
