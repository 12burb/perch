## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 9246f90: The Bot API: a bot can now live outside Perch. Mint a token on the bot's card in the Forge — you
  choose what it may do, and the value is shown once — and a program holding it posts, reads the
  channels the bot was put in, uploads files, calls a connection's tools through the MCP gateway, and
  opens agent sessions, over Slack-shaped endpoints under `/api/bot/`. Socket mode at
  `/api/bot/socket` tells it when somebody says its name, reacts, puts it in a channel, presses one of
  its buttons, or when a session finishes. Sixty calls a minute per bot, with `Retry-After` on the
  sixty-first.
  
  `@perch/bot-sdk` is the client to write that program against: `bot.chat.postMessage(…)`,
  `bot.on("app_mention", …)`, no dependencies, published to npm as `perch-bot-sdk`.
- ea3b91b: Bots can work together. One bot tags another in a thread — to ask, to fan a question out to several,
  or to hand the task over — and the answers land in the same thread, attributed. What keeps that from
  running away is on rails: six hops per conversation, no bot answering itself, a pair that keeps
  bouncing stopped on the third leg, and a budget for the whole thread that the bot which started it
  sets. When the rails stop a chain the thread pauses and a card asks a person whether to carry on, and
  anybody can type `/stop` or `/resume` themselves. The thread's header says who is in it, how far it
  went, and what it cost.
- 7ffcb04: The Forge: make a bot without writing anything. Settings → Bots has six starting points — Grok
  Newsroom, GPT Helpdesk, Claude Reviewer, Local Llama, 12birb Editor, GAM3 TALK Show Notes — and
  picking one fills the form in: what it is called, what people type after an @, what it is told,
  which brain it runs on, what it may spend, which tools it has and what sets it off. Each bot then
  shows the channels it is in, what it has cost, a pause switch, and a test chat for asking it
  something without saying it in a channel. Bots can also carry skills now — a named way of doing
  something, with its instructions — which go in front of the model with the persona.
- 3417ea3: Interactive blocks. A message can now ask a question — a button, a select, a form, approve or deny,
  and a progress bar that reports without asking anything — and answering it writes the answer into
  the block itself: the message says what was decided, by whom and when, so everybody sees the same
  outcome and it is still there tomorrow. Answering is not editing, so nothing gains an "(edited)"
  mark, and a question is answered once. The payload goes to whoever owns the block over the Bot API
  (`interaction.received`), which is the seam the bot runtime and webhooks will subscribe to.
- f39b87d: Bots that answer. A workspace can now make a bot, give it a persona and a brain, put it in a channel
  and have it reply when it is named — streaming into its message the way a person's typing fills in,
  always in the thread it was asked in. Triggers cover mentions, DMs, keywords, a bot's own arrival, a
  reaction and a cron schedule; the native tools (web search, fetching a page, reading and posting in
  channels, remembering and recalling, thread facts) are each the bot's own, and everything they bring
  back is wrapped as untrusted so a webpage cannot tell a bot what to do. Every turn is on a ledger
  with its tokens and cost, and a bot over its daily budget or its rate limit says so instead of going
  quiet.
